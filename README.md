# ðŸ§® Web Budget Calculator

## ðŸ“– Introduction  
**Web Budget Calculator** is a web application built with **Angular 20** that helps users estimate the total cost of building a website based on selected services and options.  
The app dynamically updates the final price according to the userâ€™s choices and provides a smooth, interactive interface for managing multiple quotes, filtering them, and even sharing them via URL.

This project is part of a frontend learning path focused on mastering **Angular**, **Reactive Forms**, **Signals**, and **component communication** while applying real-world use cases.
